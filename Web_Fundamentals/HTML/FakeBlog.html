        Russell Carrington Wilson is an American football quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League. He played college football for the University of Wisconsin during the 2011 season, in which he set the single-season FBS record for passing efficiency and led the team to a Big Ten title and the 2012 Rose Bowl appearance. Wilson initially played football and baseball for North Carolina State University from 2008 to 2010 before transferring to Wisconsin. He played minor league baseball for the Tri-City Dust Devils in 2010 and the Asheville Tourists in 2011 as a second baseman, and as of 2019 his professional baseball rights are held by the Trenton Thunder, a Double-A affiliate of the New York Yankees. He was selected by the Seahawks with the 12th pick in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft. After beating out Matt Flynn for the starting job during training camp, Wilson ended up having a successful debut season, tying Peyton Manning's then record for most passing touchdowns by a rookie and was named the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year.
